# RstoxDocumentation
Experimental package for generating documentation for the use of Rstox packages. 

Not all package documentation is desirable to bundle with the RstoX-package itself. They could go here. For instance: 
* Documentation that illustrates the use of RstoX packages with other packages that they do not otherwise depend on. Including these as standard package vignettes would incur the dependency.
* Verification analysis that takes a long time to run or may have indeterminate output, and is therefore not desired to be included in standard package build routines.
